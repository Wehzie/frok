## What?

Let's read a paper, then present, discuss and inquire.
Basically, a journal club.

## Why?

To learn about what our circle considers relevant work.
To seed and share ideas, to embrace habit and to enjoy.

## Where?

Online via Signal group call (screen share is supported).

Also join our Signal [group](https://signal.group/#CjQKIGAHhlxis2kyvc4qQYZQzZVKU-WamcbwhX1ml7Fhkr2YEhDHYoSSHgkMYbrEiJiR6gT_) for asynchronous communication.
