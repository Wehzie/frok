## What?

Let's read a paper, then present, discuss and inquire.
Basically, a journal club.

## Why?

To learn about what our circle considers relevant work.
To seed and share ideas, to embrace habit and to enjoy.

## Where?

Online via [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/elderlyoddsassurepretty).

Join our Signal [group](https://signal.group/#CjQKIGAHhlxis2kyvc4qQYZQzZVKU-WamcbwhX1ml7Fhkr2YEhDHYoSSHgkMYbrEiJiR6gT_) for asynchronous communication.

## When?

Thursday, [7th of September]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2023y_08m_24d-PaCi-2.ics) 2023 from 18:00 to 19:15 CEST.
Feel free to leave earlier or to stay longer.

## How?

1. We read Jaeger, H. (2021). Towards a generalized theory comprising digital, neuromorphic and unconventional computing. Neuromorphic Computing and Engineering, 1(1), 012002. https://doi.org/10.1088/2634-4386/abf151
2. Before meeting, an attendee may choose to present the paper, if so, this will be recorded here.
3. Attendees discuss.
    - Judge the quality and impact of the paper.
    - Ask questions of clarification.
    - Propose related papers.
    - Make connections to other areas of research.

Presenter and attendees may take inspiration from this [guide](https://bitesizebio.com/13633/journal-club-guide/) to journal clubbing. The [results](https://civs1.civs.us/cgi-bin/results.pl?id=E_a24b4a27a384927c) of our voting are visible on condorcet voting.
