## What?

Let's read a paper, then present, discuss and inquire.
Basically, a journal club.
Note that reading the paper isn't necessary to join the discussion.

## Why?

To learn about what our circle considers relevant work.
To seed and share ideas, to embrace habit and to enjoy.

## Where?

Online via Jitsi Meet.
The link to the event will be available here shortly before the beginning of the event.

Join our Signal [group](https://signal.group/#CjQKIGAHhlxis2kyvc4qQYZQzZVKU-WamcbwhX1ml7Fhkr2YEhDHYoSSHgkMYbrEiJiR6gT_) for asynchronous communication.

## When?

Thursday, [26 of October]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2023-10-13.ics) 2023 from 18:00 to 19:15 CEST.
Feel free to leave earlier or to stay longer.

## How?

1. You may 1) propose papers 2) vote on papers, at [Condorcet Internet Voting Service](https://civs1.civs.us/cgi-bin/vote.pl?id=E_f19684cb58b3ad78&akey=fdcd3eb6f8b55ffa). Paper selection closes on the 19 of October 2023. Note that proposing a paper doesn't require presenting it.
2. Before meeting, an attendee may choose to present the paper, if so, this will be recorded here. Without a presenter, we may go over the paper together. In case all of us slacked, we may take the abstract as a starting point for discussion.
3. Attendees discuss.
    - Judge the quality and impact of the paper.
    - Ask questions of clarification.
    - Propose related material.
    - Make connections to other areas of research.

Presenter and attendees may take inspiration from this [guide](https://bitesizebio.com/13633/journal-club-guide/) to journal clubbing.
