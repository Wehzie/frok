## What?

Let's meet and talk about life, family, friends, stuff we're working on, have read or seen and what's going on in the world.

## Why?

To enjoy and to share ideas.

## Where?

Online via our Signal [group](https://signal.group/#CjQKIGAHhlxis2kyvc4qQYZQzZVKU-WamcbwhX1ml7Fhkr2YEhDHYoSSHgkMYbrEiJiR6gT_).
Google Meet is time limited as of recently, and Jitsi's free tier lags.
