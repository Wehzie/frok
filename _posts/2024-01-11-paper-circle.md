## Summary

We read [Summary of over Fifty Years with Brain-Computer Interfaces—A Review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7824107/).

The paper isn't catchy but as expected it covers most of brain computer interface (BCI) developments.
Interestingly, you can get non-medical grade EEGs for around 200 €, we might just have to pick one up.

We abandoned discussing the contents of the paper for more recent developments around large language models.
Here's our list of entertaining videos and papers.

One of the most practical problems seems to remain calibration, the need to adapt the BCI for each user, depending on the chosen technology, even between sessions.
